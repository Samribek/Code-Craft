# CSS01 – HTML & CSS Homework (Challenge Mode)

## What I Learned:

### Exercise 1 – Advanced CSS Selectors
- Practiced using **class**, **ID**, **descendant**, and **child** selectors.
- Used `:hover` for interactivity and `::before` for custom badges.
- Learned how to use `[href^="mailto"]` for attribute targeting.

### Exercise 2 – CSS Box Model
- Understood the difference between `content-box` and `border-box`.
- Used margin, padding, border, and shadow effectively.
- Created a **tooltip-style hover** using only CSS.

### Exercise 3 – Display & Positioning
- Used **Flexbox** for layout and **absolute positioning** for image layering.
- Made nav bar sticky and tested behavior.
- Practiced media queries for responsive design.

## Notes:
- Font Awesome is used for social icons.
- All styles are included in `style.css` with comments for clarity.
- Layout responsiveness tested on small screens.
